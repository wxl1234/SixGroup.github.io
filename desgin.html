				<br>In today’s Internet Age where everything is shareable and potentially viral, us designers constantly come across new things that
			    <br> inspire us to push past boundaries in our work. Yet, how do you make sure that your project is not just visually fresh but actually 
			    <br>works for your target user? How do you get a user to embrace new UX and UI patterns without sacrificing the experience and 
			    <br>functionality?
			    <p>Here are four questions to ask yourself before you follow a trend:</p>
			</div>
			<div id="text-2">
				<p>1. IS IT RIGHT FOR THE PROJECT?</p>
				<br>Just because we see it everywhere – and even if it becomes a common UX pattern – that doesn’t mean it’s right for the project. A 
				<br>perfect example is the controversial hamburger menu. It’s commonplace and creates an aesthetically pleasing interface. Yet, it can 
				<br>hamper discoverability and leave the user feeling alienated. By fully understanding conversion goals and breadth of content, it will
				<br> become clear whether following this trend is appropriate.
				<p></p>
				
				<br>The Danish Shipowners Association’s Navigating Responsibility, for example, uses a hamburger nav because their experience is 
				<br>exploratory. Users primarily navigate their content by scrolling down the page, so having the navigation constantly visible is not 
				<br>needed. They’ve also very cleverly adapted this common pattern to complement the interaction in their desktop experience where 
				<br>screen real estate is not at a premium.

			</div>
			<div id="text-3">
				<p>2. HOW WILL THIS AFFECT METRICS AND PERFORMANCE?</p>
				<br>Metrics and performance indicators are table stakes for all clients, just as page load time and page weights are important to the user.
				<br>Parallax scrolling is a great example of how a brilliant storytelling tool, which used appropriately on sites like The Boat, may negatively
				<br>impact SEO, make for a poor user experience (especially for mobile users) with long page load times, and even cause motion
				<br>sickness! A deep understanding of what devices will be used most, type and length of content, as well as the how metrics may be
				<br>impacted will help you decide what’s right for the experience you are designing

			</div>
			<div id="text-4">
				<p>3. HAS MY USER ENCOUNTERED THIS TREND BEFORE?</p>
				<br>The keyword here is MY user. Of course you’ve seen this pattern and your colleagues have too, otherwise it wouldn’t be considered a 
				<br>trend. But, if your target user hasn’t and you don’t provide refined microinteractions and implement appropriate error prevention, 
				<br>it’ll all be for naught. Creating strong user personas based on research and interviews will help you empathize with your user, get into
				 <br>their mindset, and fully understand the UX and UI patterns they are comfortable with. Before launching the site for R+Co, we worked 
				 <br>hard to get to know the end user to determine their needs and understand what an enriching experience means to them. We
				  <br>implemented defined microinteractions to guide the user through the horizontal scroll. The result is an engaging, immersive visual
				  <br> experience, that echoes the attitude and style of these rule-bending hairstylists.

			<div id="text-5">
				<p>4. WHAT DOES MY USER ACTUALLY THINK OF THIS?</p>
				<br>The only way to find out if the trend in question will work for your user is to test and test and 
				<br>test. Testing at lower fidelities early and often provides validation and highlights issues. And interestingly enough, this can actually help you be a trendsetter as opposed
				<br> to just a follower, since you’ll be in a pattern of finding newer and better solutions. Really allowing yourself to experience things through 
				 <br>the user’s eyes can lead you to uncover a new, innovative solution or pattern. The recently refreshed Google Fonts is a lovely 
				 <br>example of understanding and researching the users needs and developing a product that was, as you know, welcomed with open
				  <br>arms (I’m a huge fan!). Take a peek into their process.
